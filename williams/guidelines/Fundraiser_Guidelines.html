          <p>Hey Fundraiser,</p>

          <p>We’re really excited that you’ve submitted a project as part of College Crowd’s pilot launch. Our goal is simple: help make your project happen by connecting you with those in the Williams Community who can offer funding and support.</p>

          <p>To this end, we wanted to provide some context around this pilot and outline a few tips to maximize your chances of raising funding.</p>

            <p>Whether the idea is a business venture, charity or academic/artistic endevor, the goal is to enable passionate individuals to receive the funding and support they need to make their project happen.</p>

            <h2><center><b>Who we are</b></center></h2>


            <p>We are Carlos Ramirez (’08), Ryan Jafari (NYU ‘08) and Thai Nguyen (’08), guys who’ve been out of college long enough to appreciate the power of relationships tied to one’s alma mater. Specifically, we’re software engineers and product managers with a desire to build things that serve a need or pain. We’re based in NYC and San Francisco.</p>

            </center>

            <p>We’re genuinely interested in your success. Please don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu">reach out to us</a> if you need help or have questions. </p>

            <h2><center><b>The Pilot</b></center></h2>

            <p>The pilot will involve publishing a handful of proposals and presenting them to over 6,000 alums and other members of the community. We are planning on sharing them on the Williams Alumni LinkedIn Group, WSO’s Announcement board and various Williams-associated Facebook Groups. We’ve seen great engagement from the community on this topic and are confident these online venues will provide a lot of exposure to the projects and their organizing teams.</p>

            <p>There are several key goals of the pilot:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Prove members of the Williams Community are willing to fund and support projects</li>

              <li>Attract funding and feedback for Fundraisers</li>

              <li>Learn what works and what doesn’t - so that we can improve for the next round</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Additionally, part of this pilot will be to determine what we need to build next. There may be some features and functionality that you would expect to be present or polished. We intentionally decided to take a ‘lean’ approach to observe how both Funders and Fundraisers interact with the functionality we’re releasing. That being said, you’ll be equipped with the ability to get funding and feedback.</p>

            <h2><center><b>How it works</b></center></h2>

            <h3><b>Step 1:</b> You submit a proposal</h3>

            <p>Congrats, you more than likely have aleady done this! As part of your proposal make sure you have done the following:
              <ol>
              <li>Adequately respond to each question on the application</li>

              <li>Clearly outline what type of ‘reward’ Funders will receive for a specific level
              of funding (e.g. What will a Funder who contributes $25 versus one who contri-
              butes $100 receive?)</li>

              <li>Be sure to submit a YouTube video of yourself briefly explaining your project (<a href="#">here’s a great example</a>)</li>
            </ol></p>

            <h3><b>Step 2:</b> You (and <i>We</i>) share and promote</h3>
            <p>The way in which your project is going to attract the most attention is if you actively share and promote it. While we will be sharing on community groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and WSO, you can help complement our efforts by sharing on your personal LinkedIn/Facebook feed, student group listservs and through general word-of-mouth. See the ‘How should I promote my project?’ section below on suggestions for tactfully promoting your project.</p>

            <p>‘Funders’ review the details of the project, message the Fundraiser and, if interested can make a donation.</p>

            <h3><b>Step 3:</b> You engage and follow up with your Funders</h3>
            <p>The funding cycle for the pilot will be exactly 30 days. If by the end of the cycle you have successfully reached or exceeded your fundraising goal, you will be provided with a list of your Funders along with their email addresses and instructed to follow up  and coordinate payment (see ‘How do I collect my funds?’ below). If you have not reached your fundraising goal but have raised some funds, you will not be eligible to keep them (see ‘What if I don’t reach my fundraising goal?’ below).</p>

            <p>During the course of the funding cycle, prospective Funders may message you to
              ask questions about your project or provide feedback. It’s strongly advisable you follow up with them promptly and courteously.</p>

            <p>College Crowd is experimenting with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_crowd_funding_services#Money_for_goods">"All-or-Nothing”</a> model. This means the Fundraiser will only receive the funds if her fundraising goal is met. The rationale is that fully-funded projects have a greater chance of success than partially funded ones; moreover, it encourages the Fundraiser to put in the effort to promote their campaign. If the fundraising goal is not met, donations are returned to Funders.</p>



            <h2><center><b>Guidelines</b></center></h2>
            <p>We have just a few guidelines to ensure expectations are met between Funders and Fundraisers. If you have any questions not addressed here, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=College%20Crowd%20Question">Thai Nguyen</a> (Williams ‘08).</p>

            <h2>Who can submit a project on College Crowd?</h2>
            <p>At the moment, projects are open to students, alums, professors and adminstrators of Williams College. Currently, proposals can be sent to <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=Proposal%20Submission">Thai Nguyen</a>.</p>

            <h2>Who can fund projects?</h2>
            <p>Similarly, the ability to fund is limited to students, alums, professors and administrators of Williams College.</p>

            <h2>What happens if I don't reach my fundraising goal?</h2>
            <p>We want to identify the funding model that best suits the community. For this first round, we’re experimenting with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_crowd_funding_services#Money_for_goods">"All-or-Nothing”</a> model. This means if you do not reach your fundraising goal but have raised some funds, you will not be entitled to keep them. The idea is that fully-funded projects are more successful than those that are partially-funded. However, you will have an opportunity to enter your proposal in the following round where we’ll test a ‘Flexible Funding’ model.</p>

            <h2>How do I collect my funds?</h2>
            <p>If you reach or exceed your fundraising goal at the end of the cycle, we will contact you and send you a list of your Funders along with their email addresses. It will be up to you to follow up with them and collect the funds.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, at the moment, we do not handle credit card processing. However, there are several options you can use such as PayPal or bank transfers that allow you to collect your funds easily (and in most cases for free).</p>

            <h2>What is not allowed?</h2>
            <p>Currently, we’re curating project submissions and using our discretion on what types are appropriate. As we continue to experiment, we’ll develop more explicit guidlines; in the meantime, we reach out to Fundraisers if we feel their project may not be well suited for College Crowd.</p>

            <h2>Is my pledge tax deductable?</h2>
            <p>In general, no. However, some US projects started by or with a 501(c)(3) organization may offer tax deductions. If so, this will be touted on the project page. If you have questions about tax deductions, please contact the project creator directly via the "Message me" button on the project page.</p>

            <h2>Are there fees?</h2>
            <p>We're currently not charging fees. However, depending on the means (e.g. PayPal) of how you collect your pledges from funders, there may be a fee assessed. We can help you find the most affordable, and in most cases free, option.</p>

            <h2>How can I promote my project?</h2>
            <p>There are several <b><i>Dos</i></b> and <b><i>Donts</i></b> we recommend you observe:</p>

              <b><i>Dos:</i></b>
              <ol>
              <li>Leverage your online social networks</li>
              <li>Be tactful - Ask for ‘support’ and ‘feedback’ (versus explicitly requesting money)</li>
              <li>Ask friends if they can spread the word</li>
              <li>Cite how many people have already funded (e.g. “We have over [number] donors and our 90% to our fundraising goal, we’re just looking for [number] more supporters...”)</li>
            </ol>

              <b><i>Donts:</i></b>
              <ol>
              <li>Badger or guilt others into funding</li>
              <li>Be annoying - spamming will likely do more harm than good</li>
              <li>Forget that feedback is as valuable as funding</li>
              </ol>
