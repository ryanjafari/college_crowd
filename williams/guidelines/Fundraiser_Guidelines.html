            <p>Hey Fundraiser,</p>

            <p>We’re really excited that you’ve submitted a project as part of College Crowd’s pilot launch. Our goal is simple: help make your project happen by connecting you with those in the Williams Community who can offer funding and support.</p>

            <p>To this end, we wanted to provide some context around this pilot and outline a few tips to maximize your chances of raising funding.</p>

            <p>Whether the idea is a business venture, charity, academic endeavor or artistic pursuit, the hope is to enable passionate individuals to receive the funding and support they need to make their project happen.</p>

            <h2><center><b>Who we are</b></center></h2>


            <p>We are Carlos Ramirez (Williams ’08), Ryan Jafari (NYU ‘08) and Thai Nguyen (Williams ’08), guys who’ve been out of college long enough to appreciate the power of relationships tied to one’s alma mater. Specifically, we’re software engineers and product managers with a desire to build things that serve a need or pain. We’re based in NYC and San Francisco.</p>

            <center>
              <div style="display:inline-block;"><IMG SRC="../../assets/img/ryan.gif" ALT="Ryan" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=96><div>Ryan</div></div>
              <div style="display:inline-block;"><IMG SRC="../../assets/img/carlos.gif" ALT="Carlos" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=96><div>Carlos</div></div>
              <div style="display:inline-block;"><IMG SRC="../../assets/img/thai.gif" ALT="Thai" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=96><div>Thai</div></div>
            </center>

            <p>We’re genuinely interested in your success. Please don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu">reach out to us</a> if you need help or have questions. </p>

            <h2><center><b>The Pilot</b></center></h2>

            <p>The pilot will involve publishing a handful of proposals and promoting them to over 6,000 alums and other members of the community. We are planning on sharing them on the Williams Alumni LinkedIn Group, WSO’s Announcement board and various Williams-associated Facebook Groups. We’ve seen great engagement from the community on this topic and are confident these channels will provide a lot of exposure to the projects and their organizing teams.</p>

            <p>Here's what we're setting out to do with this pilot:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Demonstrate that the Williams Community is a viable source of funding and support</li>

              <li>Solicit feedback for Fundraisers</li>

              <li>Learn, iterate and improve</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Additionally, part of this pilot will be to determine what we need to build next. There may be some features and functionality that you would expect to be present or polished. We intentionally decided to take a ‘lean’ approach to observe how both Funders and Fundraisers interact with the functionality we’re releasing.</p>

            <h2><center><b>How it works</b></center></h2>

            <h3><b>Step 1:</b> You submit a proposal</h3>

            <p>Congrats, you more than likely have aleady done this! As part of your proposal, make sure you have performed the following:
              <ol>
                <li>Adequately respond to each question on the application</li>

                <li>Clearly outline what type of ‘reward’ Funders will receive for a specific level
                  of funding (e.g. What will a Funder who contributes $50 receive versus one who contributes $25?)</li>

                  <li>Be sure to submit a YouTube video of yourself briefly explaining your project (<a href="http://college-crowd.com/williams/proposals/Anna_Garzon_Proposal.html" target="_blank">here's a great example </a>)</li>
                </ol></p>

                <h3><b>Step 2:</b> You (and <i>We</i>) share and promote</h3>
                <p>The way in which your project is going to attract the most attention is if you actively share and promote it. While we will be sharing on community groups on LinkedIn, Facebook and WSO, you can help complement our efforts by sharing on your personal LinkedIn/Facebook feed, student group listservs and through general word of mouth. See the ‘How can I promote my project?’ section below on suggestions for tactfully promoting your project.</p>

                <p>Funders will review the details of the project, message the Fundraiser and, if interested, can make a donation.</p>

                <h3><b>Step 3:</b> You engage and follow up with your Funders</h3>
                <p>The funding cycle for the pilot will be exactly 30 days. In some circumstances, we will consider extensions upon request of the Fundraiser. During this period, you may wish to provide relevant updates to your Funders; enlisting their assistance in promoting your project is a great way of closing the gap toward your fundraising goal.</p>

                <p>During the course of the funding cycle, prospective Funders may message you to
                  ask questions about your project or provide feedback. It’s strongly advisable you follow up with them promptly and courteously.</p>




                  <h2><center><b>Guidelines</b></center></h2>
                  <p>We have just a few guidelines to ensure expectations are met between Funders and Fundraisers. If you have any questions not addressed here, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=College%20Crowd%20Question">Thai Nguyen</a>.</p>

                  <h2>Is College Crowd affiliated or sponsored by Williams College?</h2>
                  <p>College Crowd is organized by members of the Williams College Alumni Community; however, it is <b>not</b> affiliated or sponsored by the college or administration.</p>

                  <h2>Who can submit a project on College Crowd?</h2>
                  <p>At the moment, projects are open to students, alums, professors and administrators of Williams College. Currently, proposals can be sent to <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=Proposal%20Submission">Thai</a>.</p>

                  <h2>Who can fund projects?</h2>
                  <p>Members of the Williams Community (i.e. students, alums, professors and administrators) and their friends and family are eligible to make donations to the projects of Fundraisers.</p>

                  <h2>What happens if I don't reach my fundraising goal?</h2>
                  <p>College Crowd is experimenting with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_crowd_funding_services#Money_for_goods" target="_blank">"Keep-it-All”</a> model (a la Indiegogo). This means the Fundraiser may keep any and all funds raised regardless of whether she meets her fundraising goal. In the event the fundraising goal is not met, it will be the discretion and responsibility of the Fundraiser to decide whether she can fulfill the objectives outlined in her proposal and meet the expectations of Funders.</p>

                  <h2><a name="Collecting-Funds">How do I collect my funds?</a></h2>
                  <p>Prospective Funders will be able to make a donation on your project page. If you prefer to collect immediate payment, you may set up a PayPal donation account (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Cy5JW1XxVAAMcwp-AhGajtyhzcKSKZybY8ew7-cAsQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here for step-by-step instructions</a>) and we will integrate it within your page. This payment method is subject to credit card processing fees assessed by PayPal. For for-profit businesses, the processing fee is <b>2.9% + $0.30 USD per transaction</b> (for example, on a $100 donation, you pay a $3.20 fee).</p> 

                  <p>Alternatively, we can inform you when a Funder has made a pledge, provide you with the Funder's email address and you can coordinate collection on your own (e.g. via bank transfer or cheque). This may be an attractive option if you're seeking to avoid processing fees.</p>

                  <p>Regardless of the option you choose, we will inform you each time a Funder has made a pledge.</p>

                  <h2>What should I do if I'm having problems completing my project?</h2>
                  <p>If problems come up, Fundraisers are expected to post a project update (contact <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=Project%20Update">Thai</a> to do this) and email Funders explaining the situation. Sharing the story, speed bumps and all, is crucial. Most Funders support projects because they want to see something happen and they'd like to be a part of it. Fundraisers who are honest and transparent will usually find Funders to be understanding.</p>

                  <p>It's not uncommon for things to take longer than expected. Sometimes the execution of the project proves more difficult than the Fundraiser had anticipated. If a Fundraiser is making a good faith effort to complete their project and is transparent about it, Funders should do their best to be patient and understanding while demanding continued accountability from the Funder.</p>

                  <p>If the problems are severe enough that the Fundraiser can't fulfill her project, Fundraisers need to find a resolution. Steps could include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy Funders.</p> 



                  <h2>What is not allowed?</h2>
                  <p>Currently, we’re curating project submissions and using our discretion on what types are appropriate. As we continue to experiment, we’ll develop more explicit guidelines; in the meantime, we reach out to Fundraisers if we feel their project may not be well suited for College Crowd.</p>

                  <h2>What if I'm a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization?</h2>
                  <p>You <i>may</i> be able to offer Funders a tax deduction. We advise you to seek the expertise of an accountant to verify whether this is the case. If so, we encourage you to prominently mention this on your project page as it may influence Funders' interest in making a donation.</p>

                  <h2>Are there fees?</h2>
                  <p>College Crowd is not currently charging fees. However, depending on the means (e.g. PayPal) of how you collect your pledges from Funders, there may be a fee assessed. Please feel free to contact us if you're having trouble deciding what option would best suit you.</p>

                  <h2>How can I promote my project?</h2>
                  <p>There are several <b><i>Dos</i></b> and <b><i>Don'ts</i></b> we recommend you observe:</p>

                  <b><i>Dos:</i></b>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Leverage your online social networks</li>
                    <li>Be tactful - Ask for ‘support’ and ‘feedback’ (versus explicitly requesting money)</li>
                    <li>Ask friends if they can spread the word</li>
                    <li>Cite how many people have already funded (e.g. “We have over [number] donors and are 90% to our fundraising goal, we’re just looking for [number] more supporters...”)</li>
                  </ol>

                  <b><i>Don'ts:</i></b>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Badger or guilt others into funding</li>
                    <li>Be annoying - spamming will likely do more harm than good</li>
                    <li>Forget that feedback is as valuable as funding</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h2>The funding 'tipping point'</h2>
                  <p>The first 20-30% of your funding could well be the most important. Seedrs.com, which helps startups crowdfund, reported this trend:</p>

                  <p><i>&ldquo;To date, every startup that has hit 35% funded on Seedrs has gone on to get the full 100% of its target funding. Reach 30% funded and this drops to 90%. Meanwhile, achieving 20% funded brings the odds of meeting the full target to around 80%, all the way down to 5% equating to roughly a 50-50 chance of being funded.&rdquo;</i></p>
