            <h2><center><b>What is College Crowd?</b></center></h2>
            <p>College Crowd is a service for funding projects originating from the Williams Community. Similar to popular ‘crowdfunding’ websites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Kiva, College Crowd connects individual students, alums and professors with the greater Williams Community.</p>

            <p>Whether the idea is a business venture, charity or academic/artistic endevor, the goal is to enable passionate individuals to receive the funding and support they need to make their project happen.</p>

            <h2><center><b>How it works</b></center></h2>
            <h3><b>Step 1:</b> A 'Fundraiser' submits a project</h3>

            <p>A ‘Fundraiser’(a student, alum or professor) posts her project outlining what they’re  working on, how much they’re seeking to raise and how those funds will be used. In addition, they may offer a ‘reward’ to ‘Funders’ who donate to their project.</p>

            <h3><b>Step 2:</b> ‘Funders’ review project and make a donation</h3>

            <p>‘Funders’ review the details of the project, message the Fundraiser and, if interested can make a donation.</p>

            <h3><b>Step 3:</b> If fundraising goal is met, the Fundraiser receives the funds</h3>

            <p>College Crowd is experimenting with an ‘All-or-Nothing” model. This means the Fundraiser will only receive the funds if her fundraising goal is met. The rationale is that fully-funded projects have a greater chance of success than partially funded ones; moreover, it encourages the Fundraiser to put in the effort to promote their campaign. If the fundraising goal is not met, donations are returned to Funders.</p>


            <h2><center><b>Guidelines</b></center></h2>
            <p>We have just a few guidelines to ensure expectations are met between Funders and Fundraisers. If you have any questions not addressed here, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=College%20Crowd%20Question">Thai Nguyen</a> (Williams ‘08).</p>

            <h2>Who can submit a project on College Crowd?</h2>
            <p>At the moment, projects are open to students, alums, professors and adminstrators of Williams College. Currently, proposals can be sent to <a href="mailto:08tqn@williams.edu?subject=Proposal%20Submission">Thai Nguyen</a>.</p>

            <h2>Who can fund projects?</h2>
            <p>Similarly, the ability to fund is limited to students, alums, professors and administrators of Williams College.</p>

            <h2>What is not allowed?</h2>
            <p>Currently, we’re curating project submissions and using our discretion on what types are appropriate. As we continue to experiment, we’ll develop more explicit guidlines; in the meantime, we reach out to Fundraisers if we feel their project may not be well suited for College Crowd.</p>

            <h2>Is my pledge tax deductable?</h2>
            <p>In general, no. However, some US projects started by or with a 501(c)(3) organization may offer tax deductions. If so, this will be touted on the project page. If you have questions about tax deductions, please contact the project creator directly via the "Message me" button on the project page.</p>

            <h2>Are there fees?</h2>
            <p>Currently, we don’t charge a fee.</p>
