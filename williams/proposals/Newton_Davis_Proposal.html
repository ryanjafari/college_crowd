            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

            <p>The Urban Unchained is a Philadelphia based company invested in the power of individuals, our communities, and our bikes to steer us towards a new definition of mobility. We seek to equip and inspire people to ride for the environment, their health, their happiness, and their freedom. By riding our bikes, we hope to create a more sustainable world—aligning our collective mind, body, and spirit over two wheels.</p>

            <p><ul>We hope to accomplish that through:</p>

            <li>Providing an amazing online shopping experience</li>
            <li>Provide access to top-notch information about bikes in a centralized location</li>
            <li>Connect individuals, community organizations, and business (both inside and outside) to the larger biking community</li>
          </ul></p>


          <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
          <p>The Urban Unchained is truly a work in progress. Last month I hired 4 (unpaid) interns from universities in the Philadelphia area to help execute the idea. Since then, we’ve started to build the first phase of the website which focuses on providing quality news and educational information on various aspects of the biking from advocacy and policy to design and technology. We’re also cataloging potential vendor and non-profit partners and beginning to foster relationship with organizations that will help us establish ourselves in the space. This summer, we’re hoping to penetrate the Philadelphia market, and thus far, we’ve approached 2 partners and have received very positive feedback and support for the work we seek to do.</p>

          <p>We haven’t been able to secure any funding just yet, but we’re hoping that Williams kickstarter might be a perfect opportunity to start.</p>
