            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

            <p>Samir Ghosh ‘13 and Kaison Tanabe ’13 are co-founders of LocalCycle, a social enterprise with a mission to create thriving local food economies. We are working to make transactions between local producers and wholesale, institutional buyers simple. We offer a service connecting the demand of institutional purchasers with local farmers through one-time sales and production contracts. We are building a website, www.LocalCycle.org, that makes local supply and demand visible to buyers and sellers, enables the negotiation of production contracts and one-time sales, and creates a centralized system of exchange by increasing:</p>

            <p><b>Visibility and accessibility of local food:</b></p>
            <p>LocalCycle aggregates the local, seasonal demand information from wholesale purchasers and supply information from farms, food hubs, and distributors</p>

            <p><b>Transactional stability, and reducing risk for farmers:</b></p>
            <p>In addition to a traditional online wholesale market, LocalCycle creates a marketplace for production agreements between farmers and buyers, where farmers know who they are producing for ahead of time</p>

            <p><b>Business efficiency:</b></p>
            <p>Finally, LocalCycle integrates transaction history and activity with current wholesale purchasing and budgeting software</p>

            <p>LocalCycle provides an alternative purchasing system around which new local food markets can emerge and new food economies can be structured. We are centralizing supply and demand forecasting, transaction, and management tools in a way that generates stability and savings for both buyers and sellers. This is the type of tool that has been utilized and proven to increase supply-chain efficiency and catalyze growth in other industries, and one that the local food industry lacks.</p>

            <p>Buying locally is more than just a trend; it is a fundamental shift in the way we see our food. Together, with this set of tools, we can make local food more accessible and affordable for buyers and increase margins and reduce risk for farmers."

            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>Our team placed second this year in Williams College’s business plan competition, and we have received a small amount of funding, $5,000, from the college. We have contracted with a Williams Alumni, Macklin Chaffee ‘09, to develop the beta version of our website, and we expect to complete our development by mid-July. We are paying for this primarily with our personal savings as well as with the money we acquired through the competition. At this stage in website development, we have completed approximately 80% of the beta version of our site, which is on path to offer best-in-class local food purchasing and management systems in relation to our direct competitors.</p>

            <p>We are based out of Williamstown, MA through August 2013 due to stipulations attached to the prize money as well as the network of farmers, buyers, and local food system advocates we have developed. Over the past year, we have reached out and built relationships with a variety of locally based and national local food movement organizers and advocates to shape the idea. These include but are not limited to CISA, Berkshire Grown, Mass in Motion, the Mass Farm to School Project, and The Real Food Challenge (created by Anim Steele ‘94). We have a working relationship with Williams’ Dining Services to gain feedback on and adapt our product. At the end of our senior year, we hosted a dinner between all of the college’s head chefs, purchasing managers, and a select group of farmers interested in our service; we conducted a well-received walk-through of the product that resulted in offers both by the farmers and purchasers to continue providing feedback through trialing the product. Our goal is to manage Williams’ direct farm-to-institution purchases, free of charge.</p>

            <p>We recently initiated our preliminary outreach campaign on a targeted 128 farms within and surrounding Berkshire county. We intend to populate the site with real supply information from a select group of farmers specifically interested in institutional wholesale.  Our next step is to approach buyers, aggregate their purchasing needs, and then create matches through production agreements.</p>

            <p>We are currently advised by a group of mentors assembled by the College’s Entrepreneurs at Williams program. In addition to this, however, we have active independent advisors including Williams College’s Senior Application developer and former engineer at Tripod, Chris Warren, as well as Shikhar Ghosh, father of Samir Ghosh and professor of Entrepreneurial Management at Harvard Business School.</p>

            <p>While we are currently concentrating our beta testing efforts in Williamstown, we are seeking early adopters in urban hubs, where it would be possible to create and scale this type of marketplace.</p>

            <h2>How much cash do you need?</h2>
            <p>We currently have raised funds from friends and family to complete the beta website’s development until the end of this summer. We need another month to finish our beta version, a streamlined purchasing platform that facilitates the creation of production agreements and includes payment processing and management services.  We are currently 6 weeks into development and have completed the core functionality of our product, a custom built purchasing platform that brings visibility to the local food marketplace.  However, we still need to complete payment processing and then test the site with users.</p>

            <p>Our immediate fundraising goal, to cover living expenses for the next 8 months is $20,000.  Our goal is to generate revenues by this point.</p>

            <p>Our longer term goal is to raise enough money to contract, or negotiate a profit sharing or equity stake deal to partner with, a full time Ruby on Rails developer. In order to work with institutions, our product needs to operate seamlessly with existing institutional purchasing systems, such as PeopleSoft.  After consulting with our advisor, Williams College senior developer Chris Warren, and our current developer, ‘09 alumnus Macklin Chaffee, we estimate that integration into these purchasing systems will take several months. Finally, to make our product maximally accessible, we need a mobile application along with an SMS service for text updates straight to any mobile phone.  We will be adapting our existing product to both iOS and Android operating systems.</p>

            <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
            <p>We are in need of a full-time Ruby on Rails developer interested in growing this company with us, willing to share profits and possibly take an equity share.</p>

            <p>In mid-to-major cities, we are seeking connections to:</p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Institutional purchasers that could be early adopters</li>
              <li>Local food movement advocates</li>
              <li>Potential partnerships with existing food distribution networks</li>
              <li>Advisors with experience in emerging markets.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>In addition, we would benefit from any alums that can assist us with accounting services and legal counsel.  We are specifically in need of legal counsel with expertise in the new B Corp status and/or transitioning to non-profit status.</p>
