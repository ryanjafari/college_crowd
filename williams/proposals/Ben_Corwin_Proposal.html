            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;Somewhere deep inside I have a love for snow. As I write this I am freezing, waiting for rain to change to snow in the Pamir region of Tajikistan. As a member of the Nordic ski team at Williams, I have skied thousands of kilometers, but they haven't added up to anything except for some race results. So last year I decided to ski around the world after graduation, sharing my love of snow and skiing with hundreds of small villages that are otherwise isolated during winter. The plan is to use local overland transportation in the absence of snow, and ski between villages in the prescience. Starting in S America from June until September, then heading to the Caucuses or Himalaya for early skiing and then continuing on through Eurasia. Two goals exist: to introduce village to village ski touring as a reliable source of winter income in villages, and create a creative work showcasing winter life in isolated villages which may never be visited by foreigners in winter.</p>

            <p>The more I have traveled and researched in developing mountain regions, the more the need for sustainable tourism has become apparent. In some places, like the Wakhan of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, tour operators are realizing the limits and un sustainability of jeep tours, and are turning to trekking. But the question of what to do during winter, with poor road conditions but equal beauty, still puzzles many, and drives others to drinking and other social hills. Skiers tend to be a wealthier, adventurous clientele, and developing ski tourism allows a balancing of the load of tourists on the environment, spreads wealth throughout the year, and provides winter employment when agriculture and guiding are not possible. &rdquo;</p>



            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;I have started mapping rough itineraries depending on snow, and tested the village to village touring concept in the Republic of Georgia during spring break 2013.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>How much cash do you need?</h2>
            <p>Total $10,000 minimum. This breaks down to:

              <ul>
              <li>$2,500 - airfare to S America, Eurasia and local transport</li>
              <li>$3,600 - food and lodging in villages at 5-15$ per night</li>
              <li>$1,400 - documentary and communications equipment and replacement gear</li>
              <li>$2,000 - seed funding for local ski touring projects, to go towards shipment of donated gear, printing, training of guides, and mapping</li>
              <li>$500 - insurance</li>
              </ul></p>

              <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
              <p>&ldquo;Certainly. Airfare, insurance, and mapping assistance would be more than welcome, as would be gear donations to up and coming ski programs.&rdquo;</p>

              <h2><i class="icon icon-gift"></i> What's in it for me?</h2>
              <p>According to the level of donation, some combination of maps, creative publication (photo book, DVD, etc), guided tour in a target region visited, and postcards from the journey.</p>

                <p>Rewards:</p>

                <ul><li>$10 - a postcard (not guaranteed to arrive by national postal service) from a developing mountain country.</li>
                  <li>$25 - an illustrated 8x10 map of the region of your choice, sent once the trip is complete. The maps will be a combination of drawings, topographical information, and pictures.</li>
                  <li>$50 - 2 8x10 prints from the year. Will almost surely include snow and beautiful mountains; probably people as well. Also a postcard.</li>
                  <li>$100 - a postcard from every region (probably 10-15) on the trip. Again not guaranteed to arrive though you'll get an email of the card too.</li>
                  <li>$200 - illustrated 8x10 maps of every region on the trip (probably 10-15)</li>
                  <li>$800 - A professional technical jacket (puffy, shell, or soft shell) used on the project, and a few notes about where it has been. Also 2 8x10 prints, and postcards and maps from every region.</li>
                  <li>$2000 - A spot for two fit ski mountaineers on a 6 day segment of the adventure. You'll join in discovering local routes, finding local skiers and guides, bagging possible first descents, and skinning between villages. Not really guided skiing, but a well-educated companion in exploration- you'll be on your own for transport to the nearest big town, insurance, and gear, though I'll help as much as I can.</li>
