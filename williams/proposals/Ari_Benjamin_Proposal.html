            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

            <p>We are hoping to develop an intentional community, where a select group of friends and family can settle, abiding by the virtues and values instilled within us during our liberal arts education at Williams College.  By continually assessing our environmental impact and our social relations, we commit ourselves to a holistic lifestyle of harmony and peace with all that surrounds us.</p>

            <p><b>This is a 3 pronged plan:</b></p>
            <p><ol>
              <li>For the immediate future, we intend to acquire and develop the property as specified in the fundraising goal section.  We estimate this will take 2 years.</li>
              <li>Next, we will wait for our fellow graduates who have sacrificed their morals to make excessively unreasonable amounts of money for any individual, to earn the bulk of our working capital.  This will take 5 years.</li>
              <li>At this point, we will have curated the select group of individuals who will reside in the community.  We have in the making:</li>

              <ul>
                <li>A material science engineer</li>
                <li>A culinary institute of america trained chef</li>
                <li>Several farmers</li>
                <li>Two doctors</li>
                <li>Education specialists for children</li>
                <li>An architect</li>
                <li>Environmental expert</li>
                <li>NPR journalist</li>
                <li>An auditory specialist</li>
                <li>A trained brewmaster specializing in local hops</li>
                <li>A professional Cheesemaker</li>
                <li>An expert in systems of government</li>
                <li>A specialist in canning/smoking, specifically meats</li>
                <li>A biomedical researcher</li>
                <li>A corporate lawyer</li>
                <li>A licensed slaughtermaster</li>
                <li>Three writers, two published (in literary magazines)</li>
                <li>One composer</li>
              </ol></ul></p>



              <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
              <p>This exciting project will require a significant period of development in order to become fully functional. We intend to start from the ground-up, literally.  We need funds to purchase workable, fecund farmland, as well as the appropriate materials to construct a sufficiently spacious and central headquarters, which will also serve as a teaching and living space.  We will also need funds to buy initial equipment for our agricultural ventures, as well as to purchase livestock and appropriate resources for their benefit.</p>

              <p>We are appraising several possible sites for this intentional community, ranging from $800k to $1M.</p>

              <p>Potential land sites:</p>
              <p>http://www.landsofvermont.com/vermont/land-for-sale/102-acres-in-Addison-County-Vermont/id/1160669</p>
              <p>http://www.landsofvermont.com/vermont/land-for-sale/76.08-acres-in-Caledonia-County-Vermont/id/1003902</p>
              <p>http://www.landwatch.com/Mariposa-County-California-Land-for-sale/pid/223519190</p>


              <p>For the development of the site, we will require $40,000 to procure equipment from the open source Global Village Construction Set.  This will cut expenses by a factor of 10, as we are able to produce our own industrial equipment to ensure we have a minimal set of modern comforts.</p>

              <p>We intend to limit our financial need by utilizing recycled/foraged materials wherever possible and living a fairly ascetic lifestyle, focused only on living in the most simple harmony with the land.</p>

              <p>After development, we require another $1M for the construction materials we cannot source from the land.  The bulk of this expense will be for sustainable energy procurement.</p>

              <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
              <p>We accept year-long volunteers and vacationers who want to experience an authentic, farm-to-table lifestyle from morning until night.  We offer maple syrup tapping, gardening, cooking, and canning classes, farm internships, animal tutorials and wilderness survival crash courses.</p>


              <p>Also, as our commune will be a highly desired place of living, we can utilize the assistance of any current and former military personnel to defend us from enemies within and abroad.</p>

              <p>Although we will be intensely researching over the next few months during this test trial, please contact us if you have ANY experience in communal living, sustainable agriculture, or green energy.</p>
