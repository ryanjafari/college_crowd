            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>
            <p>Derby matchdays were always a big deal for me and my soccer fanatic friends. However when we went to college, we couldn’t just all sit around the television like the old times, split a beer, making outrageous comments, point out things and generally have a good time. That’s when I began thinking about InteracTiV, an experience that is akin to having your friends on the couch next to you regardless of the distance, and one that could potentially revolutionize how we interact with multimedia contents.

            <p>Say you’re watching House; with our platform, you can comment on how amazing Olivia Wilde is looking, cut parts of of the video like House’s Eureka moment and share it with the your social network, those who watch the same show or even the world. You can even identify specific elements within the video like the actors, their history, the handbag Cuddy is carrying, and even swipe House to Cuddy and see their past interactions! And the best thing is that this platform works with all internet video sites--Youtube, Hulu, Netflix etc.</p>

            <p>We started by exploring existing solutions to tackle the problem of inadequate immersion in primary multimedia content. Companies such as “Clickthrough” and “SeeLoveBuy”, trying to capitalize on product placement, focused their efforts on the identification of elements within multimedia content through tagging/indexing of commercial products through cooperation with retailers. At the time, it seemed to be the most viable option to solve industry problems such as second screen distractions (shopping and social networking), which in turn led to decreasing returns on investment (ROI).</p>

            <p>We soon discovered that many of these existing solutions were not gaining traction in markets despite significant support. Through surveys and extensive brainstorming, and an evaluation of many successful solutions for content dissemination in other industries, we started to develop a platform that adds a social element to the existing, passive means of interacting with media content. We aim to achieve this through the novel concept of personal tagging and sharing, which leads to a feeling of ownership and investment in the content and the related metadata. In other words, by taking a plain, linear, two-dimensional audio-visual stream and superimposing layers of metadata onto it, we will turn multimedia content into three-dimensional data containers, offering radically new, fun and immersive ways to interact with your favorite content.</p>


            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>The project has been underway for the past two months. All of us put our summer plans on hold to dedicate time to this and the results have been extremely promising thus far. We have recently began coding the technology that allows people to tag and share content from across the web regardless of format. Imagine researching an article on wikipedia and having your friends comments pop up and soon enough on specific objects or characters within a youtube video along with their other interactions with the video! We are currently working with databases and video recognition technology (see Q5) to streamline the project and should have a prototype by very soon.</p>

            <p>In addition we have completed storyboarding and market analysis and now have a clear conception of our platform and what differentiates it from the competition.  We have managed to develop and incorporate a viral model of growth that is unique to our project.</p>

            <p>We are also taking part in feedback-iteration-marketing loop along the lines of the lean startup and have an active blog and a facebook group that serves to raise the platform profile and awareness as well as gain valuable feedback.Over the past month however we have been in contact with Williams college alumni who have been extremely supportive and enthusiastic and have expressed great interest in the project.</p>
