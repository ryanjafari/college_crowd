            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

            <p><b>ABOUT</b></p>
            <p>SincerelyEphs.org. is a free service that allows the Williams College community to send personalized motivational messages to one another.</p>

            <p><b>SEND TO STUDENTS</b></p>
            <p>Do you know a fellow student who is stressed, sad, or anxious? Do you want to thank them for their friendship? But do you not have the time?We can email, call, or send them a handwritten card.</p>

            <p><b>SEND TO BROADER COMMUNITY</b></p>
            <p>Do you want to send a message of hope and gratitude to professors, custodial, dining services, administration, security and souls of our greater Williams community?</p>

            <p><b>SEND OUTSIDE OF WILLIAMS</b></p>
            <p>From parents, siblings, grandpas and aunts, to childhood friends and family friends. Your sweety pie and princess is growing so fast. We want to help you share your love.</p>

            <p><b>ULTIMATE GOAL</b></p>
            <p>SincerelyEphs.org currently works by allowing students, faculty, parents, alumni, and more to send motivational messages to fellow students, faculty, and more. They fill out a respective form with the appropriate details (handwritten card, email, phone call). We allow senders to remain anonymous by not requiring their credentials, though if they provide their email, we email them when we delivered their message. The details are automatically delivered to a database in which specially selected trained students screen, access requests and then they create and deliver the message.</p>

            <p>If a sender does not know the write words to say, they just describe the situation and the write personalizes and write the message. Or they can tell us specific phrases, drawings, etc. to put in the message. However, The writing of personalized non-generic messages currently requires students to help. But when more than 150+ requests are sent within days, there is a delay in sending.</p>

            <p>We want to add an additional option that sends personalized messages immediately to speed up delivery and for when we have dozens of requests every single day. We plan to do it through random generating text algorithms. This requires rebuilding the site on a new platform, most likely utilizing Ruby.</p>


            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>I created SincerelyEphs.org during my freshmen year and attended the Clinton Global Initiative University Conference 2012 (cgiu.org) for it.</p>

            <p>When it was first launched, we received more 150+ requests within days, despite publicly launching it (just a few email to friends who then shared it with others). I realized, if we aggressively advertised it, we would not be able to meet the demand. Therefore, we still ran it, but without too much publicity, allowing the service to continue and still meet demand.</p>

            <p>I've already outlined algorithms that would allow personalized randomly generated motivational messages to be sent, but I have not been able to explore the Ruby on Rails platform for developing it myself.</p>
