            <h2>What is your project?</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;As original reporting dries up along with newspapers, and more and more communities become news deserts, the Banyan Project has developed an innovative, self-sustaining and replicable business model for Web journalism. The model is designed to ensure that communities and their residents have both the quality reporting and the citizen engagement that civic health demands. The aim is not merely to replace reporting that’s disappearing but rather to transform community journalism so that it serves democracy better than journalism ever has.  And the model is shovel-ready for prototyping.</p>

            <p>Banyan stands apart from existing approaches because it is built on the sturdy base of cooperative ownership. A committee of community leaders is hard at work preparing to launch the prototype co-op in the news desert of Haverhill, Mass.--a city of 61,000 whose daily newspaper folded 14 years ago, has no Web news site, and is served now by a weekly with only one reporter. Survey research shows strong community interest and the National Cooperative Business Association is lending in-kind assistance.</p>

            <p>The mission of the nonprofit Banyan Publishing Corp. is to seed and then support community-level news co-ops like Haverhill Matters, as the prototype is to be called. Banyan's vision is that in 10 years the number of news co-ops will match or exceed the number of food co-ops, spreading the way they did--community by community, coast to coast.</p>

            <p>Banyan Publishing will offer news co-ops a package of services, most importantly a publishing platform that not only delivers the news but also integrates easy-to-use digital tools that energize civic engagement. What’s transformative is that the tools are designed to make civic engagement so appealing, and its value so evident, that it can be monetized through co-op memberships that offer people far more than PBS and NPR: an ownership stake, a vote, and a voice in a crucial community institution--plus a share in any profits.</p>

            <p>One set of tools will invite readers to join with others who are interested in an issue to work for constructive community change, making it easy for communities to find and express their voices even as they strengthen their civic infrastructure. Another set will make crowdsourcing and other kinds of editorial collaboration comfortable and gratifying; eliciting this volunteer energy will significantly expand the scope of coverage that a small staff can handle, yielding a greater flow of news that can further nourish civic engagement.</p>

            <p>Together, these tools will provide community-scale seedbeds for the kind of shared voluntarism that, on a global scale, fuels Wikipedia. What makes the seedbeds fertile is the synergistic melding of the Web’s social connectivity and co-op ownership’s intrinsic trustworthiness, a quality that must be present for people to volunteer their engagement.</p>

            <p>Banyan-model journalism will be free for all to read--there'll be no paywalls or any other effort to monetize the news. This way the co-ops can engage the broad public of less-than-affluent everyday citizens, not just the upscale people newspapers tend to target.</p>

            <p>Banyan has created a set of specs and, using responsive design, completed the first stage of platform development.  We are seeking a grant to build the crucial engagement tools and integrate them into the platform so the Haverhill prototype can launch.</p>

            <p>Starting with Haverhill, each news co-op that Banyan seeds and supports will be an independent business owned by hundreds if not thousands of community members and each, with Banyan coaching, will deploy proven co-op techniques for raising initial capital in its community.</p>

            <p>The flow of revenue from annual co-op membership fees, when added to advertising revenue and ancillary streams, is what will make news co-ops self-sustaining.  This monetizing of civic engagement is the most fundamental of the innovations that set Banyan apart from nonprofit and for-profit community Web journalism efforts that, except in a smattering of places, are finding sustainability elusive.</p>

            <p>The co-ops will be democracy-strengthening community institutions--of, by and for their communities. They will 1) broaden the informed public; 2) strengthen its civic engagement, and 3) offer hands-on direct democracy to members--all co-ops are governed on a one-member/one-vote basis.</p>

            <p>Banyan Publishing’s revenue will come from fees affiliated co-ops pay to use its platform and for other services, which will be supplied at breakeven prices.</p>

            <p>The business model is detailed at BanyanProject.coop, a site built on the platform as developed so far. The platform will also include tools for automated marketing of co-op memberships, membership tracking and renewal, and other co-op-specific accounting and reporting features whose aim is to minimize the time and energy that the small staffs of news co-ops will need to devote to tasks other than the news and civic engagement.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;The conceptual work for the Banyan model is complete.</p>

            <p>Research has been completed for a formal business plan and it is moving quickly toward completion.</p>

            <p>The nonprofit Banyan Publishing Corporation has been incorporated in Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>Haverhill, Mass., has been selected as Banyan's prototype site and an 11-member committee of community leaders is hard at work organizing what will be the nation's first community-scale Web news co-op.</p>

            <p>The Web developer Banyan has hired, Tom Adkins, has assembled the foundation for its publishing platform and completed a full set of specs. To date the partly built platform, which uses responsive design, powers only the BanyanProject.coop website.</p>

            <p>There’s been no effort to reach out to more news desert communities that are interested in Banyan-model news co-ops, but nonetheless we have heard from 17 people who want their communities to be next.&rdquo;</p>


            <h2>What’s the opportunity?</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;The challenge Banyan addresses is to a design and prove a concept for reviving journalism and civic engagement in the growing number of communities where sources of original reporting have failed or withered to the point that they no longer come close to meeting the community's needs. The transformative opportunity is to create an approach to community journalism that serves democracy better than legacy journalism ever did.</p>

            <p>The scope of the civic challenge is laid out in this Christian Science Monitor cover story entitled <a href="http://bit.ly/W1HwKJ"> “Is the death of newspapers the end of good citizenship?”</a></p>

            <p>This <a href="http://bit.ly/uxDuSJ">Nieman Journalism Lab essay</a> by Banyan’s founder introduced the idea of news deserts and sparked a discussion that has been spreading for more than a year.</p>

            <p>And this companion <a href="http://bit.ly/ssHPf2">Nieman Lab essay</a> lays out the evidence of why a co-op model can be the remedy needed to revive news deserts.&rdquo;</p>
