            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

            <p>During the progression of my freshman year, I was slowly unveiled to a nationwide epidemic. Having come from a local suburb located in Los Angeles, California, the mental illness awareness that I carried was all that was provided in a five minute Powerpoint Presentation during my ninth grade year health class. My, along with several students across elite colleges, knowledge regarding mental illness was only that regarding depression. Throughout my freshman year I began to realize that so many students, so many individuals suffered from many of these illnesses, not just depression,without knowing it. Many have, and are continuing to go about their daily lives not knowing that what they may be suffering from is treatable and possibly even curable.</p>


              <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
              <p>I have begun gathering information regarding several psychological illnesses and the help available. Though there are several foundations dedicated to this cause, my goal would be to target high school students in public high schools in the Los Angeles area. With this in mind, I have began to contact local high school administrators regarding this effort.</p>

              <h2>How much cash do you need?</h2>
              <p>I am seeking to raise $4,000 for transportation to and from different high school schools in the Los Angeles County. In addition, this money would be invested in educational materials for students and parents, including conferences, lecturers, and readings, as well as training for students to become educational mentors.</p>

              <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
              <p>Aside from making a financial contribution, people can help through website development and marketing media aid.</p>
