            <p><b>OUR PROGRAM</b></p>
            <p>Our latest product is a 16+ Week Guide to help you lead a greater serene, joyful, and loving life. It is the research and development of data gathered from encounters and embraces with a full spectrum of magnificent individuals. From Vice Presidents who manage multimillion dollar companies, to warriors who have been victorious with their addictions for more than 15+ years, and to homeless souls who understand the beauty of, It’s a phenomenal day to be alive.</p>

            <p>Our program is not only founded on encounters with former President Bill Clinton, Google engineers, Goldman Sachs/J.P. Morgan bankers, and researchers from Stanford, MIT, Yale, and UPenn, but also positive psychology research, interdisciplinary studies, and age old wisdom. At the heart of our program lies a uniquely developed algorithm, thanks to our Computer Science approach to Positive Psychology.</p>

            <p>We promote this: just 20 seconds a day of creating new habits of gratitude, conscious acts of kindness, meditation, forgiveness, nutrition, and more, can lead to a healthier, faithful thriving, serene, joyful, and loving life, thereby skyrocketing your performance in relationships, the workplace, academia, and play.</p>

            <p><b>PROGRAM'S GOAL</b></p>
            <p>To help you lead a healthier, thriving, serene, joyful, and loving life. We prepare and empower you to explore and educate yourself in not only the miracles we discovered together, but also others that are important to you. By the end of 16+ weeks, we want to leave you a better person with a mind that is not regretting for lost joys or shame for things badly done or fear and stress for the future – a more mindful, optimistic and hopeful mind. A body that is relaxed, poised, well rested, nutritionally healthy, energized by exercise, and devoid of exhaustion. And a soul that is kinder, faithful, forgiving, gratuitous, playful and more courageous. Because when this happens, you become smarter, stronger, more motivated, and more successful in all that you do – relationships, career, education, and play. We want you, a beautiful living miracle, to overflow with health, faith, prosperity, serenity, joy, and love – a soul that dares to not only read, think, speak, and write, but also share and grow.</p>

            <p><b>PROGRAM'S APPROACH</b></p>
            <p>We developed an algorithm that maximizes the probability of creating and sticking to a habit by dynamically adapting to your current amount of mental, physical, and spiritual energy and time. Fusing our algorithm and program with your neuroplastic brain allows you to lead a heathier, faithful, thriving, serene, joyful, and loving life – its starts with only 20 seconds a day!</p>

            <p><b>ULTIMATE GOAL</b></p>
            <p>The guide (found at 20sec.org) currently takes a minimal potent experiential learning approach. Rather than disclosing the research and why the program is effective, I leave it to reader to proactively discover them. But the guide's peripheral persuasion approach requires a leap of faith. While some may be willing to take it, other will not, therefore, this summer, I will create a product that follows a central route to persuasion. It will be a motivational memoir that not only adapts the guide into a story, but also reveals the algorithm, the why and the research that supports it.</p>


            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p><b>"### Completed (Can be downloaded at 20sec.org):</b></p>

            <p><ul>
              <li>Meditation Month</li>
              <li>Conscious Acts of Kindness Month</li>
              <li>Pessimistic Optimism Month</li>
              <li>Forgiveness Month</li>
              <li>Nutrition Month</li>
              <li>Exercise Month</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><b>### Drafted (but not in guide format):</b></p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Self-Discovery</li>
              <li>Productivity</li>
              <li>Time Management</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><b>### Funding:</b></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I have not been able to invest much time on raising funding. So far, it's been out of my pocket, but well worth it!</p>


            <h2>How much cash do you need?</h2>

            <p><ul>
              <li>Web Hosting 1yr --> 71.40</li>
              <li>D.Name Privacy Protection  --> 9.99</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>Total = $81.39</p>


            <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
            <p><b>### Networking with Book Publishers</b></p>
            <p>Once I transform the guide into a book (and also translate it to Spanish), I will be publishing it as an e-book on Amazon. I would be grateful for a connection to a publisher (just so I could pitch it).</p>

            <p><b>### Printing Services</b></p>
            <p>When I completed the guide, I wanted to print copies and have them made available to the community for free. Since the guide is more than 40+ pages, it came to more than $5 per packet via online printing servies, which unfortunately, I could not afford. I have been saving up, so by mid-Fall semester, I'll be able to print more than a dozen packets for those who do not have access to a computer, printer, etc. Any suggestions on this would be invaluable and greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p><b>### Advice and critiques</b></p>
            <p>Honestly, I do not wish to make money from this. I want to give back just how I am constantly being given. I am confident in the potency of this guide. Coming from a low-income urban neighborhood and an environment of loss, depression, and addictions, these methods are what helped me overcome. And I would like to share this with others! I welcome and appreciate hard critiques on how I can improve it!"</p>
