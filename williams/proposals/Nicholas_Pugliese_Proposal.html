             Breaking Barriers by Playing Professional Soccer in Kabul

            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>

            <p>My name is Nick Pugliese ‘12, and I recently began playing professional soccer in Kabul, Afghanistan. Along with Gaston Kelly ’11 and Dave Luo we are hoping to fund the initial stages of a documentary film chronicling my experience as an American playing professional soccer in Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>

            <p>Soccer has become my tool with which to explore the types of lives that young men are living in present-day Kabul. I’m also interested in why I've been accepted as a member of the community in spite of or because of my status as an American. Through my soccer teammates, I've been: treated as family, invited to people's homes, and given an invaluable support system.</p>

            <p>I’m taking all of my experiences, and through social media outlets (Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) communicating what life is really like in Kabul. In order to reach the next level of research, I want to start conducting on-camera interviews with locals. Since my Dari is limited, I will need to employ a translator. Funds raised will go towards the cost of a Dari translator.</p>

            <p>I have always played soccer and was lucky enough to captain the 2011 Williams Men’s Varsity team. I love the game…but I didn’t realize how central it was to my identity and health, until I came to work for a telecom company (Roshan) here in Kabul, Afghanistan in June 2012.</p>

            <p>Due to the tight security restrictions of the company, I was not allowed to go play soccer for my first six months in Kabul.  Then for the following three months, I managed to convince the security team to allow me to play in an amateur league once every other week.  When I requested to be able to train at Ghazi Stadium, Afghanistan’s National Team Stadium and epicenter of pro soccer here, they said no.</p>

            <p>In mid-March, a teammate from the amateur league who also plays on the U19 National Team and the pro team called Ferozi FC introduced me to the coach of Ferozi. Ferozi FC offered me a contract in mid-April. I was terrified on one level and inspired on a much deeper one.  I resigned from my job at Roshan, even though my Afghan friends thought I was crazy not to keep my job and am now playing soccer and documenting my experience full time.  I encourage you to take a look at my blog: http://footballinkabul.com.</p>

            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>Although we have not been able to raise any initial funding, we have been working on this project since mid-April and sharing my experience through my blog and various social media accounts. I have been able to make significant progress in the following categories:</p>

            <p>From a soccer side:</p>
            <p>My team won the Kabul Cup in May beating an Afghan military team in the final. I started the game but was subbed out before a wild finish in which we erased deficits of 2-0 and 3-2 before equalizing at 3-3 in stoppage time and winning the Kabul Cup on penalties. Winning that tournament was huge and maybe my favorite moment so far in Kabul.</p>

            <p>From a community side:</p>
            <p>Soccer has allowed to me form relationships with young Afghans that never would have been feasible otherwise.  My level of Dari, the local language, is “beginner,” and none of my Ferozi teammates except two speak any English at all.  On the field, though, it doesn’t matter.  My teammates started warming up to me the moment they saw that I could play.  I live in a room in a guest house two doors down from two teammates who are also on the Afghanistan National Team.</p>

            <p>Last week my friends took me to play pick-up futsal in a local park.  Again, once the crowd there saw I could play, things just opened up.  By the second time I played there, I was greeted with high-fives and was able to jump right into a match.  A kid came up to me half-way through that second session and managed, “This is the new generation of Afghanistan.”  I’m not trying to be cliché here; this is what people are approaching me to say, unprompted. My soccer friends have become the closest thing I have to family here.</p>

            <p>From a social/media, documentary side:</p>
            <p>On June 27th, Grant Wahl, the senior soccer writer at Sports Illustrated published a story about my experience on the Sports Illustrated website. The story can be found here. Since the publication of my story, and his subsequent Tweet sharing it with his 318,000 Twitter followers, I have seen a significant spike in Twitter followers and interactions, Blog visitors, and e-mails showing support or interest for follow-up interviews. Over the last few days I have received interview requests from the BBC, the New York Times, ESPN, and numerous radio talk shows.</p>

            <p>It has been humbling to see people so interested in my story and the support I have received has been astounding. I think I am being successful is sharing what life is really like in Kabul and Afghanistan, and how sincere and kind the Afghans are, even at such a difficult time in their history.</p>

            <p>I have been gathering video footage, pictures, and writing in preparation for this documentary and even completed my first interview of one of my teammates two weeks ago. Receiving funding will allow me to increase the number of interviews I complete, and to have these interviews translated properly. These oral histories will allow me to share a much deeper look into everyday life in Kabul, and set the foundation for the documentary film."</p>


            <h2>How much cash do you need?</h2>
            <p>Our biggest resource constraint at the moment is finding a translator.  They are expensive, even here.  After doing research into fair market rates for Dari translators, which are in high demand, we estimate that we will need to raise $3,000.</p>

            <p>The idea with the interpreter is to help me pursue some more conceptual conversations with my teammates. If other teammates are thinking of immigrating, for example, but don't speak any English, I'd like to talk about that. How did they get involved [in soccer] in the first place? Do they feel this is for love or money? I have put together a list of questions and have been in contact with a couple freelance documentary producers seeking advice and guidance.</p>

            <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
            <p>Aside from making financial contributions, it would be fantastic if someone could connect us with Dari speakers that would be willing to donate their time translating the interviews. We would still need the help of someone in Kabul to do the interviewing, but we could send the audio file over and get back the English version that we could transcribe.</p>

<p>We are also always looking for people that can help us spread our story, or that can bestow advice on how to best present all of the material we are currently gathering.</p>
