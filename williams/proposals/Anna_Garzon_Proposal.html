            <h2>Tell me more!</h2>
            <p>I started Wildflour Bakery in 2011 as a Williams College sophomore. I hoped to strengthen community connections by doing what I love—baking with locally sourced, organic ingredients. The residential kitchen bakery has become a way for me to share my products with the Williamstown community while learning about owning a micro-business. I began selling baked goods at the Williamstown Farmers' Market and by special order. Pretty quickly, I had standing orders to sell at the frequent ‘Billsville House Concerts’ and to a few Williams College department and club meetings. In my first year I was busy enough to turn down orders and still have enough business to be profitable.</p>

            <p>This year, my goal is to expand the capacity of Wildflour Bakery in order to fill the growing demand from Williams College and the Williamstown community. I’ve recently completed an agreement to provide pastries for the student-run Goodrich Coffee House for the coming year. I am hoping to raise $2000 to purchase equipment that would allow me to increase the production and efficiency of Wildflour Bakery. By increasing Wildflour’s capacity, I can fulfill the Goodrich Coffee House request and reach the Williams College community on a larger scale, as well as expand into other markets in the Williamstown community.</p>

            <p>For those interested in more detail: Goodrich has asked for 30-45 pastries 2-3x per week. A countertop convection oven would make the baking process much more efficient; it has the capacity for four pans instead of the two allowed in a normal oven, and it provides a second baking space so that I can simultaneously bake different pastries at different temperatures. Other items that would make the process run more smoothly include more sheet pans, a small rolling rack for easy sheet pan stacking and space efficiency, sheet pan covers for clean transport of baked goods, and an appealing display case for my pastries at Goodrich. Finally, I’m also hoping to buy my own market equipment, including an EZ Up canopy and a couple folding tables (I borrowed from a local farmer friend last year). With my own equipment I will have more flexibility to attend markets or events other than just those available on the days when the borrowed equipment is available.</p>

            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p>I have had extensive, hands-on experience running Wildflour Bakery for one year already (I studied away my junior year, and Wildflour Bakery has been on hiatus). I know that the bakery fills a niche in Williamstown, and that people are very receptive and positive about my baked goods. I have learned what the community wants, and how to talk to customers about the baked goods if changes need to be made. I’ve been successful enough that there is a clear demand for me to expand into new markets, such as the Goodrich Coffee House.</p>

            <h2>How much cash do you need?</h2>
            <p>$2000 total. All prices below are estimates based on preliminary research I have done.
              <ul>
              <li>Countertop convection oven ($1000)</li>
              <li>Five new sheet pans ($25 total)</li>
              <li>Sheet pan rolling rack ($100)</li>
              <li>Five sheet pan covers ($15 total)</li>
              <li>Website ($100 for the year)</li>
              <li>EZ Up canopy ($200)</li>
              <li>Tables ($100 for two)</li>

              <li>Custom-built display case ($100-200)</li>
              </ul></p>

              <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
              <p>Yes! First and foremost, I welcome any and all suggestions/tips/advice on running a small or micro-business of any kind. I would love to hear from you, even if you cannot or do not want to donate, please reach out—I love making connections. I’d love create or be part of a network of people who are working in any part of food production—from crafting compost to making wine to running a CSA, I’d love to hear about all of it. If you happen to have any skills in website design and would be interested in helping, I’d also love to hear from you (I am planning to use SquareSpace, but if anyone has a better suggestion, I’m definitely open to it).  I would also be interested in speaking with someone who has tips on the financial aspects of running a small business in Massachusetts.</p>
