              <h2>Tell me more!</h2>
              <p><b>GOAL: Purchase new equipment to allow Wildflour Bakery to expand its capacity to fill growing demand from Williams College and the Williamstown community.</b></p>

              <p>About Wildflour Bakery:</p>
              <p><ul>
               <li>started in 2011 by Anna Garzon ‘13, a Williams sophomore at the time</li>
               <li>currently sells at Farmers’ Markets, concerts, and through special orders</li>
               <li>For more detailed information, go to the Wildflour Bakery <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wildflourwilliamstown/info" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>, or check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wildflourwilliamstown/photos_stream" target="_blank">Facebook photos </a> to get an idea of what I like to make.</li>
             </ul></p>

             <p>I started Wildflour Bakery in 2011 as a Williams College sophomore. I hoped to strengthen community connections by doing what I love—baking with locally sourced, organic ingredients. The residential kitchen bakery has become a way for me to share my products with the Williamstown community while learning about owning a micro-business.</p>

             <p>I began selling baked goods at the Williamstown Farmers' Market and by special order. Pretty quickly, I had standing orders to sell at the frequent ‘Billsville House Concerts’ and to a few Williams College department and club meetings. In my first year I was busy enough to turn down orders and still have enough business to be profitable.</p>

             <p>This year, my goal is to expand the capacity of Wildflour Bakery in order to fill the growing demand from Williams College and the Williamstown community. I’ve recently completed an agreement to provide pastries for the student-run Goodrich Coffee House for the coming year. I am hoping to raise $2800 to purchase equipment that would allow me to increase the production and efficiency of Wildflour Bakery. By increasing Wildflour’s capacity, I can fulfill the Goodrich Coffee House request and reach the Williams College community on a larger scale, as well as expand into other markets in the Williamstown community.</p>

            <h2>What progress has been made?</h2>
            <p><ul>
              <li>experience running Wildflour Bakery for a year</li>
              <li>completed an agreement to provide 30-45 pastries to Goodrich Coffee House 3x weekly</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>I have had extensive, hands-on experience running Wildflour Bakery for one year already (I studied away my junior year, and Wildflour Bakery has been on hiatus). I know that the bakery fills a niche in Williamstown, and that people are very receptive and positive about my baked goods. I have learned what the community wants, and how to talk to customers about the baked goods if changes need to be made. I’ve been successful enough that there is a clear demand for me to expand into new markets.</p>

              <h2>Can I help without donating cash?</h2>
              <p>Yes! First and foremost, I welcome any and all suggestions/tips/advice on running a small or micro-business of any kind. I would love to hear from you, even if you cannot or do not want to donate, please reach out—I love making connections. I’d love to create or be part of a network of people who are working in any part of food production—from crafting compost to making wine to running a CSA, I’d love to hear about all of it.</p>

              <p>I could also really benefit from financial advice. If you know anything about the finances of running a small business, I’d love to speak with you.</p>

              <p>Finally, if you happen to have any skills in website design and would be interested in helping, I’d also love to hear from you (I am planning to use SquareSpace, but if anyone has a better suggestion, I’m definitely open to it). <a href="mailto:wildflourwilliamstown@gmail.com">Feel free to email me!</a>
